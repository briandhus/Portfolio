      <p title="About Brian Huston">I am a software developer with experience writing javascript, html5, bootstrap, react, node, mysql and mongoDB to name a few. I have a background in music, having been a professional musician for fifteen years, which allows me to use my creativity when writing programs and styling applications. </p>

      <p>I stumbled across web development, online, about five years ago and found that I really enjoyed it. This past fall, I decided to take a more serious step towards becoming a full stack developer. I just finished a course at UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp, and I feel confident that I can step into a work environment and create and contribute to some awesome projects wherever I land next.</p>

      <p>I am an excellent communicator and team player. I don’t let my ego get in the way, and I accept that people communicate in different ways. I’m good at pulling the best out of someone and identifying when they need help, and identifying when they need space. My upbeat attitude and light-hearted nature warm up any environment.</p>
