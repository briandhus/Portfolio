      <p title="About Brian Huston">I am a software developer with experience writing JavaScript, HTML5, ES6, Bootstrap, React.js, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and the MEAN stack to name a few. In addition to a desire to continue writing software, my strong communication skills, with colleagues and customers, would be put to excellent use in a role as a Customer Support Engineer or a Technical Support Engineer. I have a background in music, having been a professional musician for fifteen years, which allows me to use my creativity when writing programs and styling applications. The music business is also a business of marketing and teamwork, to which I have learned many things, while enjoying the process thoroughly.</p>

      <p>I am also familiar with the other side of the development process as I am able to apply the Challenger Sales methodology to utilize the nexus of my knowledge of software development and passion for people-facing endeavors. I bring a passion and positive attitude to any work environment, and I truly enjoy making new friends and learning new technologies.</p>

      <p>Of course life's not all about work. When I'm away from the computer, I enjoy drumming, singing, reading, hiking, running, and playing tennis or basketball.</p>
